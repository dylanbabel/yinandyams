***A light a refreshing grain salad for a barbecue side dish or a base for a delicious lunch!***

When planning a balanced dinner in my house we start with a protein and pair it with a grain or starch and a vegetable. I have been getting pretty bored of our usual plain rice, quinoa, or roasted potatoes and decided it was time to change things up! All of a sudden, I remembered that quinoa salads existed (it had been at least a year since I last made one) and this recipe was born! 

This recipe is sweet, tangy, and light. It pairs perfectly with barbecue or makes and awesome base for a buddha bowl type lunch (check the bottom of this post for a pic!).

# ***~ {{ page.title }} Recipe ~***

## Ingredients:

### Salad

* 2 cups of corn
* 1 cup red onion diced
* 1 cup red bell pepper diced
* 1 cup dry quinoa
* 1 cup feta cheese
* *Optional:* diced cilantro

### Dressing

* 4 tbsp lime juice
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp honey
* Cracked pepper to taste

***

## Directions:

1. Add 1 cup of dried quinoa to a pot with 2 cups of water. Place pot on stove on boil. Once boiling cover with a lid and turn to low. The quinoa should take around 20 mins to cook. Check by gently sticking a fork in the quinoa and looking for remaining water at the bottom. When there is no water left and the quinoa has become fluffy, it is finished.
2. Remove pot from the heat and gently fluff with a fork. Place the quinoa in the fridge to cool. (If short on time, place the quinoa in a bowl and in the freezer stirring frequently).
3. While the quinoa cools, add corn, onion, red pepper, and feta cheese (and the optional cilantro) to a large bowl.
4. In a separate bowl, combine lime juice, olive oil, honey, and pepper to taste to make the dressing.
5. Once cool, add the quinoa to the bowl along with the dressing and gently combine.
6. Serve right away or place in the fridge to marinate for at least 1hr.
