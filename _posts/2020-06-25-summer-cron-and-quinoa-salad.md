***A light a refreshing grain salad for a barbecue side dish or a base for a delicious lunch!***

When planning a balanced dinner in my house we start with a protein and pair it with a grain or starch and a vegetable. I have been getting pretty bored of our usual plain rice, quinoa, or roasted potatoes and decided it was time to change things up! All of a sudden, I remembered that quinoa salads existed (it had been at least a year since I last made one) and this recipe was born! 

This recipe is sweet, tangy, and light. It pairs perfectly with barbecue or makes and awesome base for a buddha bowl type lunch (check the bottom of this post for a pic!).
