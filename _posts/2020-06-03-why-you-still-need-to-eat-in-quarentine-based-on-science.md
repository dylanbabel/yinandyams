***Friends and family joking about the "Quarantine 15"? Well here is why SCIENCE says you shouldn't start cutting the calories drastically...***

I have vowed to keep content regarding you know what on my platforms minimal in an attempt to create a place where you can take a break from the world. However...this is something I feel that I must touch on, especially for those like myself who have struggled (or are struggling) with their personal relationship with food and eating. 

> "Eat when you are hungry, stop when you are full. Eat for your health, but also eat for your soul" - Yin & Yams 2020

With gym closures, food shortages, emotional eating, and a general feeling of no control, the anxiety around gaining weight has intensified for many people. Sources reveal that those with a past or current struggle with disordered eating may find themselves relapsing as a result of one or many of these factors.

On top of everything, many of us are spending more time on social media and are being BOMBARDED with at home workouts, pressures to "use this time productively", diet tips, and of course the quarantine 15 jokes. While much of this content is intended to inspire individuals or lighten a dark situation, some of us do not respond well to these messages. Some of us feel guilty that we can't seem to get into a routine or that we can't  motivate ourselves to be productive or workout. In addition, weight gain jokes make us feel anxious and out of control. If this is you, go and delete, unfollow, and block what and who you need to right now. 

I will tell you now. This time is about taking care of YOU in whatever form that manifests in. Some of us may need to keep busy with learning something new, and that is amazing! However, others may need to take a break and watch countless hours of Netflix. Guess what, that is valid too. Don't penalize your friends and family for being "unproductive" If you are person one, and don't feel guilty if you are person two. Productivity will look different on all of us, especially right now, and as long as you are making an effort to take care of yourself and your emotions with positive outlets, you are doing fabulous. 

Now that I have gotten that rant out, on to the science! Stick with me here...

Calories and metabolism are two hot words year round, but especially right now. I think most of us understand that calories are the amount of energy contained in our food. But, I don't think everyone understands what metabolism is. This understanding will help you to see WHY you still need to eat enough during this time even if you aren't moving so much.

Your metabolism is basically all of the chemical reactions that occur inside your body that produce energy for you to live. Metabolism consists of three main components that tell us where this energy is being used and ultimately will determine how many calories your body needs in a day:

## 1 - Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
Your BMR is a number that tells you how many calories (or how much energy) your body needs when you are at complete rest. This means lying down, not moving. This energy is what is required to keep your basic bodily functions...functioning, including breathing, blood circulation, and cell repair. BMR is determined by your body size and composition (how much muscle you have), your sex, and your age. 

## 2 - Thermogenesis
Thermogenisis is literally the amount of calories that it takes for your body to digest, absorb, and transport the food you eat. This is where the theory of "zero calorie" foods like celery come from (a.k.a it takes the same or more calories to eat the food than it's worth).

## 3 - Physical Activity
This definition of physical activity doesn't just mean going to the gym or getting in an at-home workout. In this case, physical activity includes any movement of your body from going to the store, getting up and down from the couch, and walking in your neighbourhood (or typing on your laptop *wink wink*). 

So you're telling me that I burn calories sitting on my couch and eating?! Win! But seriously, lets look at a graph: 

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" alt="This is a pie chart of metabolic components: 5-10% Thermic, 20-30% Physical, and 50-80% BMR" %}

So yes, you do burn calories doing these two effortless activities. In fact, BMR makes up the majority of the energy that is used at 50-80%! Of course I think exercise is so important for our physical and mental wellbeing, but the point is, of you aren't able to achieve as intense workouts as you once did in the gym/are not moving as much, your body STILL NEEDS calories and food to function. To keep you alive!

Please do not give into diet culture and please keep fueling your body properly. It is essential for maintaining a healthy immune system! Eat when you are hungry, stop when you are full. Eat for your health, but also eat for your soul.

Keep staying positive everyone! You've got this :)
