***Gluten free, refined sugar free, dairy free, and vegan.***

I have never been a huge fan of energy balls. They never seem to turn out quite right for me and are not really something I personally turn to grab for a snack. However, I made another attempt to perfect my own recipe and I must say, I think I nailed it! These energy bites are so tasty, they disappeared before I could get a photo of more than just one! They only require a few ingredients and are quick and easy to make. Enjoy!
