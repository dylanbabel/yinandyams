I have never been a huge fan of energy balls. They never seem to turn out quite right for me and are not really something I personally turn to grab for a snack. However, I made another attempt to perfect my own recipe and I must say, I think I nailed it! These energy bites are so tasty, they disappeared before I could get a photo of more than just one! They only require a few ingredients and are quick and easy to make. Enjoy!

# ***~ {{ page.title }} Recipe ~***

***

## Ingredients:

* 10 large medjool dates
* 1 1/2 cup rolled oats
* 1 tbsp vanilla
* 2 tbsp chia seeds
* 2 tbsp almond butter
* 2 tsp Macca powder
* chocolate chips
* salt

***

## Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350C.
2. Add the dates to a bowl and just cover with water. Soak for a minimum of 10mins.
3. Remove dates from water (keeping the water for later) and blend dates in a food processor or blender until smooth. Add in 1/2 cup of oats and blend until smooth.
4. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Add another 1 cup of rolled oats, vanilla, chia seeds, almond butter, and macca powder. Mix to combine.
5. Add chocolate chips (as much as you prefer) and salt to taste. Continue to stir in the date water until the mixture is a slightly sticky consistency (sticky enough to form the ball shape).
6. Form the balls (I ended up with 11) and place on a lightly greased baking tray. 
7. Bake for 20mins until dry on the outside.
8. Let cool and store in an air-tight container for up to 3 weeks in the fridge.
