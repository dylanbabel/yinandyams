Winter is loooong. Especially in Canada. I know that we are reaching the end of the days of grey skies and mad dashes between the toasty car and front door, but I find the last stretch of winter can sometimes be the toughest. So, even though spring is soon on its way, I thought I would discuss some of my tips to start thinking about for next winter (and the end of this winter), especially if you struggle with SAD.

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" %}{: .align-left}

## 1 - Get outside.
One of the major changes I made this past winter was getting outside for regular walks. I stopped driving to school every morning of the week and bundled up for the 20min walk instead. This required me to be more organized in the mornings to give myself this time, but it has definitely been worth it. Walking outside helped me to adjust to the cold and made me feel so much more awake (especially if I caught the sun). It also gave me a time to reflect and almost meditate as I had 20mins to myself to just think or listen to a podcast. 


## 2 - Take supplements.
I typically take calcium and multivitamins all year round, but this winter I decided to up my game. I began incorporating a vitamin D3 into my winter routine and believe that it has played a significant role in boosting my mood and energy (as I notice the difference when I forget!). Make sure your supplements are always legitimate as you don't want to be putting anything unsafe or unregulated in your body (products that are licensed for sale in Canada and are safe for use will have a Natural Product Number (NPN), a Drug Identification Number (DIN), or Homeopathic Medicine Number (DIN-HM) on the bottle). 


## 3 - Eat well and move your body. 
Getting in some quality exercise and nutrition will completley change your mood and energy levels. Make sure you take the time to eat a colourful diet that is abundant in fruits, vegetables, and micronutrients during the winter whilst getting your sweat on and releasing that dopamine! 


## 4 - Socialize.
Personally, I find myself retreating from friends and family to stay home alone in the winter. It may be the most comforting, but getting out and spending fun time with the important people in your life is crucial in the winter months. I stopped saying "no" to invitations out (unless I knew I truly needed time to myself), and made an effort to socialize.


## 5 - Invest in a sun lamp.
This winter I began to use my sun lamp every morning. My lamp turns on when my alarm goes off and I lay in bed with it on me. I also tend to get dressed and ready for the day in front of my light. These  lamps help to treat SAD by providing the essential "sun" light (without harmful UV rays) that we tend to miss during winter months. The light triggers the release or serotonin (your happy hormones!) and restoration of your circadian rhythm.


## 6 - Get yourself ready.
I know it's tempting to stay in cozy clothes all day in the winter. However, a big part of my journey to beating SAD this season was getting myself ready for the day. I put effort (even though sometimes minimal) into what I wore, and sometimes even wore a bit of makeup, even if I only had class to go to. Getting ready and feeling confident improved my mood and helped me feel as though I could conquer my day. 

## 7 - Brighten up your space. 
If you have the ability to change around your living space and decorations, definitely take advantage. Making little changes around your home such as adding more colour, flowers, plants, and other touches that keep things bright and cozy will help you feel more energized. 

## 8 - Take up hobbies. 
Since many of us spend a lot of our free time inside during the colder months, this is prime time to take up or work on some of your hobbies. Paint, draw, read, play music, journal, make a blog...whatever makes you happy! Alternatively, learn a winter sport and kill two birds with one stone (or three?) by getting outside with a hobby that is active!


I hope these tips help you to get through the last of the winter months. SAD can be hard, but there ARE steps that you can take to ease its symptoms. Make sure to take care of yourself and be observant of those around you as they may befit from these tips too. Reach out to your supports and try to stay positive! On another note, I am NOT a professional, a doctor, or a psychiatrist. Therefore, if you are seriously struggling, make sure to discuss with a professional to determine what steps are right for you and your journey!
