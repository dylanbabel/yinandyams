***Gf, df, refined sugar free and easy!***

Another delicious granola bar recipe to add to your repertoire! These bars can be made with some swaps to fit what you have in your own cupboard and your taste. I found these bars a bit sweeter and more decadent than what I usually make (take this with a grain of salt as I do not eat very much processed sugar so find things a lot sweeter than other people!) and they were a huge hit in my apartment of and two guys (who love their cliff and vector bars) and m


As I have said before, making your own snacks at home (especially ones like bars that come wrapped individually) is so awesome for your health, blood sugar, wallet, and the environment! Making your own snacks allows you to control what ingredients you put into your body including refined sugar and preservatives. Best of all, you typically create less waste overall...so get on the snack making train!

# ***~ {{ page.title }} Recipe ~***

***

## Ingredients:

For the base:
* 2 cups rolled oats
* 1/2 cup roughly chopped almonds*
* 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips
* 1/4 cup dried blueberries roughly chopped**
* 2 tbsp chia seeds
* 1/3 cup honey***
* 2 tbsp almond butter
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* 1 tbsp melted coconut oil
* 2 pinches of salt
* cinnamon to taste
### For the chocolate drizzle:
* about 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (I ended up with extra so you could eyeball it depending on how much topping you want)
* 1 tbsp coconut oil (adjust if using less chocolate)

***

## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350C.
2. Add all base ingredients into a medium bowl. With a wooden spoon, stir well until combined and tacky.
3. Lightly grease a baking dish (I used a 9x5 glass dish). Pour mixture into dish and spread evenly.
4. With a metal spoon, smooth out the surface and press firmly to pack down the mixture. This step is essential for helping your bars stay together.
5. Place the baking tray in the oven and bake for 20mins until lightly browned on the edges.
6. During the last 5mins of baking, add the 1/4 cup of chocolate chips and 1tbsp coconut oil into a small pot for the drizzle. Stir continuously on medium heat until the chocolate has fully melted and combined with the oil. Remove from heat.
7. Remove the baking tray from the oven and with a spoon, drizzle the chocolate over the surface. Finish with a sprinkle of sea salt.
8. Once cool enough, place the baking tray in the fridge to continue to set. Once the chocolate drizzle is fully hardened (after a few hours), cut the bars using a sharp knife (I ended up with 10 bars).
9. Store in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks (if they last that long!).
