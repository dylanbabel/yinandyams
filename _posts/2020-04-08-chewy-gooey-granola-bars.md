***Refined sugar free, healthy, easy, and delicious! (can also be made vegan)***

Granola bars are such an awesome snack or addition to your breakfast! However, if you are trying to reduce your waste and ensure you are eating all good ingredients, you should try this recipe to make your own! 



## **~ Chewy, Gooey, Granola Bars Recipe ~**

***

### Ingredients:

* 1 cup rolled oats
* 2 tbsp chia seeds
* 1/4 cup chopped nuts (I used almonds)
* 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds 
* 1/4 cup dried cranberries
* 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips
* 1/2 tbsp cinnamon
* sea salt 
* 1 egg*
* 1/4 cup peanut butter 
* 2 tbsp honey**
* about 1/2 cup almond milk 

### Directions:

1. Set oven to 350C.

2. Mix together oats, chia, nuts, seeds, cranberries, chocolate chips, cinnamon and salt (to taste) in a medium bowl (feel free to customize with whatever nuts, seeds, and mixing you like!).

3. Whisk egg in a separate bowl and add to dry ingredients along with peanut butter and honey. Mix until combined. 

4. Add almond milk and stir until mixture is fully moistened and sticks together (I used about 1/2 a cup).

5. Grease baking dish.

6. Pour mixture into baking dish and press firmly with a spoon or hands. Sprinkle with extra cinnamon and sea salt. 

7. Bake for 10-15mins (watching closely) until the edges and top begin to brown.

8. Let cool for up to an hour before cutting into bars and eating (it will fall apart if you cut too early!).
