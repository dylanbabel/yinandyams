*__"BEEP...BEEP...BEEP". Your alarm goes off. You told yourself you would wake up at 6AM, go to the gym, and finish your work before starting your day. You hit snooze. An extra 10 minutes couldn't hurt. You hit snooze again...and again...and suddenly, its 8AM...__*

Getting out of bed in the morning can be hard. Especially if you are not naturally a morning person. 


Starting my day early has completely changed my life and productivity. Waking up at 6AM each morning allows me to go to the gym, read, meditate, finish last minute homework and eat a good breakfast with my SO before school. I am able to accomplish so many tasks in addition to boosting my mood and reducing anxiety and stress. I am no longer rushing out the door, have time to plan and prepare for my day, and am able to give myself a moment for daily self care. 


I don't recall being a morning person for most of my teenage life. My mom would have to come to my room multiple times in the morning to shake me awake so I would'nt keep falling back asleep! It wasn't until I got to university that I started trying to consistently wake up early. This is deffinitley something that takes dedication and is a habit that must be learned and maintained in order for it to become easier and easier.


 So without further ado, here are my top 6 tips to getting out of that cozy nest of blankets in the morning and accomplishing whatever is important to you!


## 1 - Go to Bed!
Seems obvious right? You are never going to get up at 6AM if you go to bed at 1AM every evening, or morning I should say. Calculate the time you need to be asleep in order to get at least 8hrs each night. An hour before this bedtime, start to wind down. Avoid screens (or use blue light blocking lenses/nightshift mode if unavoidable) and start getting ready to sleep. Change into comfy clothes, do your nighttime skincare/teethbrushing etc., get some tea, and do whatever you like to do to relax (I recommend reading!).  When your bedtime hits, no matter how good your book or show (on a screen you should not be looking at!) is getting, turn out that light and get some sleep.

## 2 - Just. Get. Up. 
Just do it. Don't think about it and don't even consider any other options. STOP hitting snooze. You will be more tired if you keep going back to sleep. You made a promise to yourself when you set that alarm the night before, so don't break it. Don't let yourself down before your day even starts.

## 3 - Have a Routine
If you don't know why the heck you are even waking up at ungodly hours of the morning, why would you be motivated to do it? Figure out what you want to do in this time each morning. Do you want to read a book, journal, mediate, finish homework, work on a side hustle, or go to the gym? Maybe a combination of these things? It can be hard for us to find the time to do things for ourselves day-to-day. Take this time as a gift to yourself to work on you, what you love, and what makes you excited. Make this routine consistent each day, which means waking up early on the weekends too (yes. I mean it). 

## 4 - Ease Into It
Just like building any other habit, you are more likley to fail if you go cold turkey. Try easing your way into an early schedule by waking up a little earlier each week until waking up at your goal time seems manageable. This could look like setting your alarm 15mins, 30mins or even an hour earlier each week. It all depends on how difficult early rising is for you, and how soon you want to be getting up at your goal time. (But if jumping right in to a new routine is your style...hello fellow type A's...go for it!)

## 5 - Get a Friend or Partner Involved
Now this one just might get you an eye role and a "Not in your wildest dreams". However, if you are able to find someone that is willing to get up with you, it can help you to be accountable and stay consistent. This is especially helpful if you are living with a partner (as it is very easy to just stay cozy in that blanket nest together), or a roommate. In addition, this tip is good when you are looking to include a morning activity such as the gym that can be done together. However, if you plan to spend this time on your own in silence, you may wish to skip this one.

## 6 - Move Your Body
Again, this may not be for everyone depending on your intentions for this time. However, if you are considering adding something active into your early morning routine, I highly suggest it. Moving your body helps to make you feel awake and releases dopamine and other happy hormones to help reduce stress throughout your day. It is amazing getting your gym session out of the way before you are able to make excuses not to go, and are feeling drained. Personally, this tip makes me feel accomplished, even if the rest of my day is unproductive. 

I hope these tips help to get you started on your early morning routine journey. Stay determined and stay consistent. Remember, it takes 30 days to build a habit! If you do need the extra sleep somedays, do not feel guilty. Always listen to your body and what it needs. Also, if you are not interested in waking up early, then that's okay too! There is not one perfect routine for everyone, and every routine is valid and right if it works best for you!
