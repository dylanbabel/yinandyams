I'm sure you are all just as tired as me when it comes to hearing or reading about the current situation of our world. Rather than adding to the plethora of bad news, anxiety, and panic, I thought it would be more productive to spread some positivity at this uncertain time. 

I have seen a lot of influencers making an attempt at promoting positivity surrounding this situation and absolutely love the message they are spreading: recognizing that yes, even though things are bad, this is the universe telling us to slow down. Telling us to start coming together and unify in hope and support, leaving behind our differences both globally and on a personal level. Another way that influences are spreading positivity is by being a space that lacks discussion about the situation to create a safe environment for others to escape the madness for a while. I hope to become the latter for all of you.  

With this in mind, as many of us are confined to our homes from school and/or work, I think we should try our best to have gratitude for this time of self reflection that has been given to us. Being negative and part of the panic does no good for anyone. It is our time to stay calm, level headed, and considerate of our communities close and far (stop hoarding food and toilet paper people!!! Ahem.....).

As I am in university right now, I know this is a very confusing time for us students. The first thing I will be keeping busy with is completing outstanding assignments and homework that is still expected from my teachers. To my fellow students out there, please be patient with your schools and teachers. This has been such a sudden and difficult change for the academic world to work around, especially for schools with little or poor online infrastructure for online classes and communication. Things will get sorted and we will graduate! However, I also extend my empathy to the graduating years who had no idea they had taken their last class with their uni friends. 

Another big concern for some of us, especially the community that makes up my followers, is the closing of gyms and athletic centres. I have been completing a program designed by my awesome friend Sam Kirk (thanks!) and have been loving having fun in the gym again and seeing major progress in my strength and physique. With recent changes, it looks like I will be switching over to outdoor jogs and bodyweight workouts. To support this, many individuals in the fitness world have been sharing bodyweight workout ideas and free yoga or fitness classes via livestream, so keep an eye out! I am definitely going to use this time to enhance my flexibility, cardio, and take a few livestream dance classes. 

I will also be taking this time to appreciate the beautiful spring weather that has arrived in Nova Scotia and exploring some outdoor spots that I have never had the chance to with school keeping me busy. My roommates and I are planning some hikes, outdoor climbing, and beach combing to keep us busy and moving!

Finally, I will be spending a lot of time working on the things that I love. My journal will be getting lots of use again, and my pile of books to read will start to shrink (p.s. if you have any good recommendations please message me!). My guitar that I pick up every month or so will no longer be dusty, and my paint brushes will be out on display drying from many painting sessions. My sneakers will be muddy from hikes, my oven warm from baking, and my friends just a little bit closer (while still practicing social distancing!!!  ;)). 

Stay safe, and stay informed. Never spread unreliable information and reach out to those around you. We will get through these tough times and life will get back to normal again! It just might not be the same normal that we were once used to. xoxo
