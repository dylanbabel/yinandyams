***Refined SF, GF, DF, V, and chocolate FILLED***

I usually stray away from store bought granolas as they are often filled with refined sugars and are very high in calories. I mean, 300+ calories and 20g of sugar for only 1/2 a cup? I mean come on. Most of us have at least one cup of granola if not more. Of course everything in moderation, but if you want to avoid a blood sugar spike and that afternoon dip, it's time to level up your granola game and get in that kitchen! 

So, if you are looking for an easy, relatively cheap and guilt free granola that tastes like chocolate macaroons, look no further! Enjoy this chunky, chocolatey goodness!

# ***~ {{ page.title }} Recipe ~***

## Ingredients:

* 1 cup rolled oats
* 1 tbsp chia seeds
* 1/2 cup chopped nuts ( I used 1/4 cup almonds and 1/4 cup walnuts)
* 1/2 cup coconut chips*
* 2 tbsps cocoa powder**
* 1 tbsp melted coconut oil 
* 1/2 cup honey OR maple syrup 
* dark chocolate chips or chopped dark chocolate bar***
* dairy free milk of choice 
* salt 

***

## Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350C. 
2. Line a baking tray with parchment paper. 
3. Add oats, chopped nuts, coconut chips, chia seeds, cocoa powder, and a pinch of salt to a medium bowl. Stir to combine. 
4. Add melted coconut oil and honey OR maple syrup to dry ingredients. Stir to combine.
5. If the mixture is too dry, add a splash of dairy free milk until the mixture is thoroughly moistened. 
6. Poor mixture onto the baking tray. With a metal spoon, flatten the mixture into a sheet (like a big granola pancake!) and press firmly.
7. Bake for 10 mins. 
8. After 10 mins, pull the granola out and gently break the granola into smaller chunks with a spoon. Sprinkle dark chocolate on top of the granola (as much as you prefer), in addition to a sprinkle of salt.
9. Bake for 5 mins
10. Remove from oven. If the granola seems hard when tapped with a metal spoon, it is done. 
11. Let cool. Make sure not to mix the granola as it cools or else the chunks will break.
12. Once cool, break granola chunks into your size of preference. Store in airtight container for up to 2 weeks.

_Recipe notes:<br>
*could sub for shredded coconut, but the granola will not be as chunky. Also keep in mind that sweetened shredded coconut will contain refined sugar.<br>
**could sub for cacao powder for extra antioxidants and a health boost! <br>
***to keep this recipe vegan and dairy free, check chocolate ingredients for milk._
