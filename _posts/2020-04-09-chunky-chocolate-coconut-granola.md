***Refined SF, GF, DF, V, and chocolate FILLED***

I usually stray away from store bought granolas as they are often filled with refined sugars and are very high in calories. I mean, 300+ calories and 20g of sugar for only 1/2 a cup? I mean come on. Most of us have at least one cup of granola if not more. Of course everything in moderation, but if you want to avoid a blood sugar spike and that afternoon dip, it's time to level up your granola game and get in that kitchen! 

So, if you are looking for an easy, relatively cheap and guilt free granola that tastes like chocolate macaroons, look no further! Enjoy this chunky, chocolatey goodness!
