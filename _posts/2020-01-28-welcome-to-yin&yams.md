Whether you know me in person, came from my old blog, or are a total stranger, you should totally stick around for some exciting content all about food, nutrition, fitness, health, and self care! Now for a bit about me...

My name is Hannah Chapeskie and I am 20 years old from Ontario, Canada (despite what the above photo may lead you to believe). I grew up with my mom, dad, and two super cool older twin sisters who I worshiped as a little girl (and honestly still do!).

I also grew up dancing from the time I was 2 and half years old until the age of 18. By the time I was 10, I was dancing competitively and spent almost every day training at my dance studio. It was at the studio where I was greatly shaped into the person I am, for the better and the worse. It was at dance where I learned dedication, hard work, mind over matter, success, failure, and teamwork. It was also where I learned how to pick myself apart, doubt myself, and where my eating disorder both budded and bloomed (more on this topic later...). 

After graduating high school I left for the beautiful ocean of Nova Scotia, my sisters who lived there, and of course for school. I started studying Nutrition and am currently on the path to becoming a registered dietitian, a passion that stemmed from both my love and issues food. 

After many years of work, very supportive family, friends and boyfriend, I am finally finding peace and balance with food and my life. I hope to one day help others who struggle with disordered eating to heal their relationships with food and teach people how to lead their lives with a little bit of yin and a heck of a lot of yams (because they are definitely a superior food).

Now, I am in my third year of university with a passion for photography, fitness, food, and adventure, and in need of a way to combine my interests into one fabulous project...and that is where you and this blog come in! 

So if you're interested in my adventures, recipes, advice, sweet potatoes, and life as a dietetic student (and soon to be intern), I recommend subscribing to my emails and following my instagram for daily updates, photos, and notifications of new blog posts!

See you around!


Hannah Chapeskie
