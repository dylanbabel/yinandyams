# ***New to sourdough baking? Here are some things I wish I new when I was getting started.***

I have been working with sourdough for over a year now and can confidently say that there is a LOT of information out there on the internet. This journey can be intimidating and overwhelming as it seems almost everyone has their own opinion and advice. A lot of this comes down to personal preference and method as a baker learns their craft and makes it their own. 

I want to help lay out all of the basics and tools you need to get started on your sourdough journey. My soon to be  sourdough guide will cover everything you need to know, but in the meantime, here are 5 things I wish I knew when I was a beginner in the world of sourdough.

# 1 - Starter Temperature
Your starter is alive! But for real, this is your new pet so take care of them (and maybe even name them too?). Just like any pet, your starter doesn't like to get too chilly, or too hot. Most commonly, our air conditioned or winter chilled homes are too cold for our starters.

The optimal temperature for yeast and bacterial growth in your starter is around **70-85Â°F**. The growth of yeast in your starter is essential for rise in your bread through the production of carbon dioxide. The bacteria (don't worry these aren't the "bad" guys!) are what produce the sour tang through lactic acid. Thus, keeping your starter the proper temperature is key to keeping these organisms alive for amazing breads.

There are many solutions that do not include purchasing an expensive bread proofer. My favourite method includes microwaving a mug of water and adding my starter into the steamy microwave right after. Ensure to reheat the water every so often REMOVING the starter first as it should not be microwaved. 

# 2 - A Chilly Starter
But, I though you just said to keep it warm? When making a starter or prepping a starter for baking, a warm temperature is needed. However, when you are not baking, your starter can be kept in the fridge for storage to suit your baking needs and your budget. 

To store your starter in your fridge simply feed your starter as normal and allow it to ferment on the counter for an hour. Then, cover it with a lid and put it in the fridge! The starter still needs attention, but now only once a week. 

During this weekly feeding, remove the starter from the fridge and allow it to warm up for a few hours at room temperature. Then, feed as normal and place back in the fridge for another week OR feed it for a couple of days and use it to bake!

# 3 - Flour Type
I was very confused as to what the "rules" were around flour when it came to sourdough. Here are a few questions I had and the answers I have found:

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" %}{: .align-right}

## *Do I have to bake with the same flour that I feed my starter with?*

It is recommended that you use the same type of flour in your baking that you make your starter out of (e.g. whole wheat starter for whole wheat baking). 

The yeast in the starter is accustomed to digesting the type of sugar in the flour it is fed. However, most bakers say that you can get away with using different flours despite what your starter is made of.

## *Do I need to feed my starter the same flour?*

Yes! Yeast in your starter feed off of starch which is found in all grains. However, when adding in a new flour, it may take a couple of feedings for the starter to "bounce back" and be ready for use (especially if you are going from whole wheat to white. Vise versa seems to be less dramatic).

Another option is to feed your starter a blend of flours that you plan to bake with like 50% white and 50% spelt. This "trains" the culture to digest the flours you feed it. In this example, you would easily be able to bake with white, spelt, or a mix of both flours  without altering your starter again and again. 

## *White or whole wheat bread?*

Whole wheat bread is considered more nutritious as it contains the bran, germ and endosperm of a wheat kernel. White flour only contains the endosperm and lacks the portions of wheat high in fibre, minerals, vitamins, and even fats.

When it comes to sourdough, I personally have found working with white AP flour easier, cheaper, and more convenient as a beginner. Whole wheat sourdough can be a different and more difficult experience but is definitely a superior option when it comes to health benefits, flavour, chewiness, and density. Additionally, you can also use a blend of flours when baking to develop a loaf that is suited to your taste and texture preferences through experimentation and practice!

# 4 - Peak Starter Use?

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery_2" %}{: .align-right}

I have my starter, I fed my starter, can I bake now? Welllll...in order to get the best possible results, it is important to use your starter when it is at its peak. This window of opportunity is between 4 and 12 hours after feeding when it has risen to its peak level and has bubbles on the surface. 

A great way to ensure your starter is at its peak is to use the float test:

1. Fill a glass of room temperature water.
2. Gently mix starter a few times to distribute bubbles (DO NOT over-mix. You will pop all the bubbles!).
3. Take a spoonful of starter and drop into the glass. 
4. **If it floats, it is ready for baking! If not, you have either waited too long, waited too little, or your starter is not healthy and needs some help!**

# 5 - Baker's Schedule
You may have looked at some sourdough recipes and noticed that they take hours and hours to complete. Or maybe you didn't and got half way through a recipe realizing that you will end up baking the bread at 2AM. 

My biggest tip is to look at the recipe before you get started, maybe even the day before, and get an idea of what is happening when and for how long. Personally, I like to look for any proofing times (the long period/s where the dough sits to rise) and kneading periods. If there is a proofing period that can go for 8+hrs, I will plan my bake so that this longer proof lands when I am sleeping and I will continue the bread the next day.

Having a baking schedule that makes sense and is natural takes a lot of practice. I recommend sticking with one or two recipes and getting into a good flow with them before expanding your repitoire. By sticking to the same recipe you will also be able to learn more about your potential mistakes as you experience variations from loaf to loaf.

Happy Baking and do not give up! Keep experimenting, researching, and eating! I know you can do it!
