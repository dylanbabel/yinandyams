# ***New and exciting things are here!***

So guys...if you have been keeping up with my instagram these days you may have seen me talking about some exciting projects I have taken on. Without further ado, Yin&Yams is now selling sourdough starter! *cheers...whistles...* 

So how the heck does that work might you ask? Well, I am able to dehydrate stater, pack it up, and mail it to you for your own baking! All you have to do is spend a few days rehydrating the starter and feeding it to grow it big enough for your own fun.

I have had some questions about why one might want to purchase this over making their own starter, and here are my answers to that: 

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery_2" %}

Basically, NOT starting from scratch will give you tastier bread (or pancakes, or scones, or...so many things) AND is more forgiving, or less easier to kill, as it is more established! A great option for my sourdough beginners out there who are looking to learn!

In addition to this project, I am currently working on creating a beginner's sourdough guide that is both simple and comprehensive. I am including some background on sourdough, a bit of science, information on how to do it yourself, and some recipes! I think it is soooo important to understand HOW and WHY your baking works to be able to fix your mistakes and maybe even make your own recipes, so stick with me there! 


So how do you get ahold of some starter? As of now, I have the starter available through Yin&Yam's SHOP button in your menu bar. Alternatively you can purchase on the new Facebook page which you can find here. They are only $7 for a starter that you can grow and keep for years! 


Thank you so much for all the love. I have had about a million questions about my sourdough lately and thought it was time to help you guys out! If you want to support me and have a little fun doing so, definitely check out this product and follow our Facebook for updates!
