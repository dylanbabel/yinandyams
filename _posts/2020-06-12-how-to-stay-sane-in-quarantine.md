***Feeling unmotivated, unproductive, and generally lost in quarantine?***


That's totally okay. You are not alone. You are allowed to feel these things and give in to them. We are not living in a normal world right now and we are all feeling pretty thrown off. However, for the sake of our mental health and sanity, I do believe that it is important to try and establish some normalcy during this time. A full day of Netflix, YouTube, or loafing around is completely acceptable if that is what serves you right now, but doing so on the daily definitely won't make us feel our best. 

If you are feeling unmotivated, unproductive, and generally lost in quarantine, here are some things that I have been doing the past few months that have helped me to break through some of those barriers:

## 1 - Develop a routine or schedule.
{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" %}{: .align-right}
Our "normal" lives are generally structured and scheduled. We have work, school, and other commitments that fill our days. Even though many of us are still doing some sort of work from home, we now lack the element of moving locations and have maybe lost the element of time. It becomes easy to put off completing work OR to work for hours and hours on end.

Whether you are currently completing some form of work or not, I have found developing a consistent at-home routine essential for my sanity. Establishing a time to start activities that are important like work and scheduling in time to take breaks, eat meals, relax, and spend time with family will not only increase your productivity and efficiency but help to prevent burnout. Take advantage of tools such as calendar alerts and reminders or even your phone timer to help you stay on track with important tasks and periods of rest.

The most important piece of establishing an at-home routine is consistency. Once you find what works for you and makes you feel good, stick with it until you feel it is time to shake things up. Many of the following tips cover activities that I have integrated into my own routine to create a feeling of normalcy in my life.

## 2 - Wake up!
Part of your routine should include a consistent wake up time. I will always vouch for early rising, but I can understand that there may be an extra temptation to sleep in when there is not much to do during the day. However, waking up early and allowing yourself to either A. take it slow or B. grind out some some tasks or a workout (whichever suits you best!) will completely change your entire day. Sleeping in can leave you feeling groggy and unmotivated. Not to mention, your day seems to disappear that much faster!

**TIP:** another big one is making your bed as soon as you wake up. An unmade bed is just an invitation to jump right back in for more sleep. Studies show that this simple action will help you feel motivated to accomplish more in the day. And hey, even if you don't, at least you make your bed!

## 3 - Get yourself ready.
One of my favourite tips is to get yourself ready for your day. Even though you may not be leaving your house, get out of your pajamas, freshen up, and even do your makeup and hair (if you feel like it of course!). I have been making an effort to at a minimum, get out of my panamas every single day in quarantine. This action creates a separation for me and helps me to feel like I am getting in the zone to do productive tasks.

## 4 - Go outside. {% include gallery id="layouts_gallery_2" %}{: .align-left}
I have mentioned this a few times, but one of my new year's resolutions was to take daily walks and to generally get outside more often. I am so proud to say that I have stuck to this resolution pretty well, even during quarentine, and am definitely reaping the benefits.

Whether its walking, hiking, sun tanning, or playing Frisbee, get outside! (bonus if you are getting some exercise in). Being cooped up inside all winter and then all summer is the route to vitamin D deficiency which will most definitely not help to boost your mood or motivation. I cannot express how good I feel when I get outdoors enough, especially in the summer sun!

## 5 - Exercise.
I know you know, but I had to put it here! Personally, I have been enjoying running, walking, biking, yoga, and at-home pilate style workouts. If you now have access to your gym (not me sadly), take advantage of the opportunity! Exercising will release hormones that will help improve your mood and and enhance your immune system. Exercising also helps to wake me up and give me long lasting energy all day.

## 6 - Spring clean.
If you are spending a lot of time at home, it is important to keep your space tidy and organized. Spend time each week finishing regular cleaning chores and take extra time when you can to deep clean and organize. Go through those junk drawers, files, and closets getting rid of anything that no longer serves purpose in your life. I know many donation centres are currently refusing donations at this time, but you can always try to sell your gently used items through various websites like kijiji and even Facebook buy and sells and make a bit of money while you're decluttering! 


## 7 - Learn a new skill.
I think this one is also kind of obvious, but I find it hard to actually START something new. I find that when I am busy and have no time, there are about a million things I want to try and project ideas I have in mind. However, when I suddenly have time to complete a project, I feel unmotivated and decide to just waste my time scrolling on my phone instead. Can anyone else relate?

Now that you probably have a LOT of time on your hands, why not actually start that project or hobby that you have been putting off. Filling your time with useful and enjoyable activities is so much more fufilling than the alternatives. And who knows, you may even discover a new passion or business idea! 

## 8 - Put away the technology.
{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery_3" %}{: .align-right}
I think we can all agree that our screen times have skyrocketed during quarantine. For a lot of us this may be a necessity for work and/or school or even for our new skills we are learning. If you absolutely must be on a computer all day I would highly recommend purchasing a pair of blue light glasses to save your eyes. You can find them for relatively cheap on Amazon. 

For those of us who have the luxury of turning our attentions away from the tech, try picking up a hobby that doesn't require the computer or your phone. Read a book, take a walk, paint, draw, play a board game, do a puzzle, learn how to knit...the options are endless. Consider including your housemates OR family and friends in other households via video chat! 

## 9 - Cook for yourself/your family.
Personally I love cooking and baking. However, as a busy student I don't always have the time to try out new recipes and experiment. Take this time to cook something new and to prepare a nice meal for yourself and/or family. Baking of course is included in this tip and is a great treat to drop off on a friends's doorstep. Don't feel "basic" if you want to jump on that banana bread or sourdough baking trend. (P.S. if you are thinking about jumping on the sourdough wagon check out our shop!). 

## 10 - Write snail mail to family and friends.

Growing up, my two older sisters were off at school and in the world by the time I was about six. Some of my favourite memories (and one of the reasons I think that we still have  had a strong relationship over the years despite the distance) was snail mail. We would send back and forth letters, little trinkets, drawings, and basically anything fun that could fit into a small bubble envelope.

Not enough people send handwritten letters anymore and not enough people even practice writing by hand! I have experienced the magic of snail mail myself and I PROMISE you, nothing compares. It is so thoughtful, exciting, and fun, especially in today's tech obsessed world. So pick up some paper and get writing to your family and friends!

And that's all from me today! I hope you took something away from this post and will implement some of these ideas into your own daily lives. As I said in the beginning, one of the hardest things to do when it comes to anything is to just start. So just start! Ease yourself into a routine that feels right to you but also serves you mentally, physically and emotionally. Start with something small like a morning ritual of coffee, reading a few pages of a book and eating a healthy breakfast. Start with getting out of your pyjamas each day or even walking for just 10mins. Whatever step you choose to take first is up to you, but the fact that you made an effort and started SOMEWHERE is all that matters.
